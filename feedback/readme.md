# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for Jalil Garvin Mingo

### Python Script Implementation

- Your `main.py` file successfully reads the CSV file, processes the data, calculates statistics (average happiness ratings and session durations), and prints a well-formatted report.
- The implementation of dictionary updates and the use of the `max()` function to determine the highest average values is correct and fulfills the assignment requirements.
- The output produced by your script exactly matches the expected output provided in the assignment instructions.

### Report Document

- Your `report.md` is clear and structured. It contains an introduction, methodology, results, and observations that align with the project objectives.
- The insights you provided regarding the performance of the algorithms (e.g., noting that DeepPulse had a low happiness rating despite longer session durations) are thoughtful and indicate a good level of analysis.
- The overall tone and professionalism in your report are appropriate for the assignment.
