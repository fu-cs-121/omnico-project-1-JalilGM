## Introduction

[Provide a brief overview of the project objectives and the importance of the analysis.]

The project objectives was to analyze the data of three algorithms: JoyStream, SerenityFlow, DeepPulse,
to help understand which algorithm is performing best.

## Methodology

[Describe the steps you took to perform the analysis, including any calculations and reasoning behind them.]

I noticed I need to use division to calculate the averages of the happiness stats and the duration stats of each algorithm.
Also had to count how many sessions each algorithm had to see which was more favored.
Then I had to get the max of the averages in order to see which alogrithm had the best stats in each catergory of stats.

## Results

- **Average Happiness Rating per Algorithm**

  - JoyStream: 8.5
  - SerenityFlow: 7
  - DeepPulse: 5

- **Total Number of Sessions per Algorithm**

  - JoyStream: 4
  - SerenityFlow: 3
  - DeepPulse: 3

- **Average Session Duration per Algorithm**

  - JoyStream: 37.5 minutes
  - SerenityFlow: 30.0 minutes
  - DeepPulse: 45.0 minutes

- **Highest and Lowest Performers**

  - Algorithm with Highest Average Happiness Rating: JoyStream
  - Algorithm with Longest Average Session Duration: DeepPulse

## Observations and Insights

[Discuss any patterns, anomalies, or noteworthy findings from your analysis. Include any ethical considerations or unexpected results, especially related to the DeepPulse algorithm.]

- I noticed that even though DeepPulse had such a low happiness average it was played the longest. Which I was unexpected and raises questions about that algorithm.
- Its seems JoyStream had the best stats outside session duration, which raises questions of why was played less than DeepPulse(who has a lower happiness rating and amount of sessions).

## Conclusions and Recommendations

[Summarize your conclusions based on the results and provide any recommendations for next steps or further analysis.]

- From my analysis it seems that JoyStream is the best algorithm so far. But in order to get a more accurate analysis, I would like more stats to regarding the users and their experience.
